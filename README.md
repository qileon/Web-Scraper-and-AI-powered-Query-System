# Web-Scraper-and-AI-powered-Query-System

## 1. INTRODUCTION  
This project is a tool that combines web scraping and Googleâ€™s AI to collect and analyze website content. It has a simple interface where users can enter URLs and search queries.

## 2. REQUIREMENTS AND SPECIFICATIONS  
The program needs Python libraries (requests, bs4, tkinter), a Google API key, and an internet connection. It uses BeautifulSoup to process web content and tkinter for the interface.

## 3. TESTING  
The program was tested with different websites to check if it could collect and analyze content correctly. Tests also included invalid URLs and empty inputs to ensure errors were handled properly.

## 4. RESULTS  
The tool successfully extracted headings and paragraphs and used AI to answer search queries. Invalid or broken links showed error messages without crashing the program.

## 5. CONCLUSION  
This tool is an easy-to-use program for scraping and analyzing websites with the help of AI, offering a reliable way to process online information.
